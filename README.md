# Front Times Instructions  
```md 
Given an input string and a non-negative int n, we'll say that the front
of the string is the first 3 chars, or whatever is there
if the string is less than length 3. Set result to n copies of the front;

Output
• for input of "Chocolate", 2 -> "ChoCho"
• for input of "Chocolate", 3 -> "ChoChoCho"
• for input of "Abc", 3 -> "AbcAbcAbc"
```
